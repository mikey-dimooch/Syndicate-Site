                Syndicate was founded by Mikey and Andrew in early 2024, who met at The University of Tampa. After recruiting fellow student Colin, 
                the three played their first show on campus in January. Syndicate played their first show as a full lineup with Kesler in April, after 
                he met Mikey and Andrew at a Guitar Center. Now, the band plans to make a buzz in the local Tampa metal scene and beyond, with a sound 
                inspired by classic thrash bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Testament, and Sepultura.

                        Hailing from Barrington, Illinois, Mikey picked up guitar during the peak of COVID lockdowns. Once the lockdowns were lifted, 
                        Mikey joined his high school's jazz band, but always had more of an enjoyment for heavier music. Inspired by guitarists like 
                        James Hetfield, Dave Mustaine, and Matt Heafy, and bands such as Testament and Black Sabbath, Mikey co-founded Syndicate in 2024 after moving to 
                        Tampa in August of 2022.

                        Kesler is a Florida native, he started playing music on a bass he inherited from my grandpa, and first song he learned being Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth). 
                        He then picked up electric guitar and joined percussion in school around the same time to broaden his horizons. He's been playing for about 6 years now 
                        and is excited to finally be involved a band.

                        Growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, Andrew began playing drums at six years old, inspired by classic rock drummers Neil Peart and John Bonham. 
                        In high school, Andrew began playing heavier songs by bands such as Slayer and Metallica, majorly looking up to Dave Lombardo. He joined local thrash 
                        band Deceptor until moving to Tampa in 2022. Now most previously of alt metal band NONPERSONA, Andrew co-founded Syndicate in 2024.
