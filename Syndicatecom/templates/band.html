                    <h4>Rhythm Guitar/Vocals</h4>
                    <p>
                        Hailing from Barrington, Illinois, Mikey picked up guitar around April of 2020 during the peak of COVID lockdowns. Once the lockdowns were lifted, 
                        Mikey joined his high school's jazz band as a novice guitarist, but always had more of an enjoyment for heavier music. Inspired by guitarists like 
                        James Hetfield, Dave Mustaine, and Matt Heafy, and bands such as Testament and Black Sabbath, Mikey co-founded Syndicate in 2024 after moving to 
                        Tampa in August of 2022.

                        Kesler is a Florida native, he started playing music on a bass he inherited from my grandpa, and first song he learned being Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth). 
                        He then picked up electric guitar and joined percussion in school around the same time to broaden his horizons. He's been playing for about 6 years now 
                        and is excited to finally be involved a band.
